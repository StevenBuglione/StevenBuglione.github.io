# Welcome! 👋

I'm Steven Buglione, a Software Engineer with professional experience with Backend Technologies. 
🚀 My professional pursuits aside, my heart beats for all things tech, especially the realms of Containerization 
and Kubernetes. This fascination seamlessly extends to my home lab—a place where my passion for technology transforms 
into hands-on experiments. In this personal tech playground, I explore, tinker, and demystify the intricate world of 
technology. It's not merely a career for me; it's a journey of continuous discovery and learning.

## The Birth of Klustered.us 🌐

Klustered.us originated from a spark of creativity when selecting a domain name for generating an HTTPS certificate for 
my homelab. 🏠💡 Finding the name catchy, I decided to not only invest in it but also transform it into the cornerstone 
for my personal tech blog.

## Vision for the Future 🌟

As I lay the groundwork, my ambitions for this blog and the possible expansion of other services under its umbrella are 
sky-high. 🛤️ Everything kicks off on GitHub Pages at https://klustered.us, but that's just the starting line. Down the 
road, I'm eyeing a transition to fully self-host everything on my personal home lab. This move isn't just about control;
it's about creating a space where I can experiment, learn, and share without limits. Keep an eye out for what's to come, 
including a dedicated spot for this blog at https://blog.klustered.us.

## The Art of Writing & Creation ✍️

While penning down thoughts isn't my foremost passion, crafting technical documents for future reference certainly 
sparks joy. 📖 Given time constraints outside my professional life, I lean on AI models for initial drafts, ensuring 
each piece resonates with my unique voice and perspective. 🤖➡️📝

Stay tuned for exciting updates and don't hesitate to connect for any inquiries or feedback! ✨
